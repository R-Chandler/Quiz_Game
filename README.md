## Design
### Colour Scheme
- I used a scale of blue shades across the site to create a theme.
- All text has been left as black to stand out against the other colours.
- All panels within the game area have been made 'antiquewhite' to stand out and keep all the text easily readable. 
### Typography
- 'Lobster' was used for headings to be bold and stand out.
- 'Roboto' was used as the font for questions and answers across the website due to assists with readability for users.
